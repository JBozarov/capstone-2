<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
    I read the requirements carefully, make sure understood it. 
    I have to build terminal based 2D game, and must be fully functional, so users are able to play it. 
    I must implement Java 4 pillars in the game. Those are, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction and Polymorphism. 
    I must have at least 1 interface, 1 abstract class, 1 lambda and 1 stream. 
    I must have at least one package. Also error handling for bad input ( try catch ). 
    
* clicked each game examples 
* watched tutorials about snake game, pong game and one Udemy tutorial video about Java Game processing library

// Problems.  
* I need to learn how to implement gaming libraries that used in tutorials 
* learning what ascii code is 
* I am facing IIOException cannot read the file error 
* Learning about JFrame watched tutorial 
* Learning how to create graphical user interface using JFrame 
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

* In order to choose what game I will be building I watched 3 java building game tutorials. I just wanted to choose simpler game and create MVP and meet all the requirements. I know I always can add more features if I have a time. Honestly I was lost on one tutorial which was creating pong game. Because his code was much more complex and I did not understand many of his codes, so I stopped watching it. And when I finished watching the other tutorial about building block breaker game using java and JFrame, I felt like I understood it and I felt like this is something that I can learn and build my own game in Java. Because this tutorial was more simpler code than other two tutorials.
